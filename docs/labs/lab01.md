## COMP130 - Introduction to Computing

### Lab 01 - Course Tools and Practices

This lab will introduce you to some of the tools and practices that we will be using throughout the semester.  Please complete the Pre-Lab Preparation outlined below before coming to your lab period.

#### Pre-Lab Preparation

1. We will be using *pair programming* for the labs in this course.  As an introduction to this practice watch either (or both) of the following videos to get a feel for what it is and how to use it effectively in the classroom:
  - [Pair Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) [2:50]
  - [Pair Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7d_JtyCq1A) [2:20]  

  Optional:
    - Both of those videos are younger students, but they give incredibly good introductions to the practice.  If you need some convincing that pair programming is a also a serious professional practice check out this video in which Lucy Bain at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com) talks about her experiences with [Pair Programming in professional settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl1PTUQvcX0) as a professional developer [11:02].
    - There is also a lot of evidence that [pair programming provides significant learning benefits](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08993408.2011.579808) particularly for students in introductory computer science courses.

2. Read the following sections of [the text](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html):
  - [1.1-1.5](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2002.html) - The way of the Program
  - [2.5](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2003.html#sec20) - Order of Operations
  - [5.1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2006.html#sec55) - Floor Division and Modulus
