## COMP130 - Introduction to Computing

### Lab 01 - Course Tools and Practices

This lab will introduce you to some of the tools and practices that we will be using throughout the semester.  Please complete the Pre-Lab Preparation outlined below before coming to your lab period.

#### Pre-Lab Preparation

1. We will be using *pair programming* for the labs in this course.  As an introduction to this practice watch either (or both) of the following videos to get a feel for what it is and how to use it effectively in the classroom:
  - [Pair Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q) [2:50]
  - [Pair Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7d_JtyCq1A) [2:20]  

  Optional:
    - Both of those videos are younger students, but they give incredibly good introductions to the practice.  If you need some convincing that pair programming is a also a serious professional practice check out this video in which Lucy Bain at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com) talks about her experiences with [Pair Programming in professional settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl1PTUQvcX0) as a professional developer [11:02].
    - There is also a lot of evidence that [pair programming provides significant learning benefits](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08993408.2011.579808) particularly for students in introductory computer science courses.

2. Read the following sections of [the text](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html):  

  - [1.1-1.4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2002.html) - The way of the Program

    - For section 1.2 you do not need to worry about trying to run Python.  Just understand that there are lots of ways to run Python and that any of the ways will allow you to enter and run (also called executing) statements.  He discusses one way.  You will learn another way in this week's lab.  If you would like to try what he suggests of course you should, but if you find it confusing or difficult remember that you are expected to be able to do it on your own at this point. You'll be learning how to execute Python statements in lab!  

  - [2.5](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2003.html#sec20) - Order of Operations  

  - [5.1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2006.html#sec55) - Floor Division and Modulus  
  
    - Focus on the operations here.  This section also uses variables, and we'll get to those soon. For now they are not something you need to worry about. Just think of the names as any other value used in an expression.
